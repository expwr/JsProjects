This is going to be a compilation of all the vanilla js projects I have been working on or have finished. These will consist of tutorials I have done off of someone else, there will normally be alterations to their projects or future alterations going to be done. Some of these are to practice logical components and some are also usable functions that can be implemented into a website.
